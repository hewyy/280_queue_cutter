# 280 queue cutter
## Overveiw
Python script that allows you to bypass the 280 help queue by utilizing Selenium to automate the process. Just put your username and password in and let it rip!

## Prerequisites
```
Python 3.8 (i'm sure other versions would work too, 3.8 was just what this build was tested on)
Selenium
Chrome Webdriver
```


## How to use this script
After installing Selenium and the Chrome Webdriver, you will need to link the location of your Chrome Webriver with my script.
You can do this by replacing the location of your chromediriver.exe into the filename parameter (line 32)

Now just enter your username, password, your name (this is the name that you'll show up on the queue with) and the help you need.
